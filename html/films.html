                <p>However, before he could assume his responsibilities with United Artists, Chaplin had to complete his
                    contract with First National. So early in 1921, he came out with a six-reel masterpiece: The Kid, in
                    which he introduced to the screen one of the greatest child actors the world has ever known - Jackie
                    Coogan.</p>
                <p>Later in 1921, he released “The Idle Class”, in which he portrayed a dual character. Then, feeling
                    the
                    need for a complete rest from his motion picture activities, Chaplin sailed for Europe in September
                    1921. London, Paris, Berlin and other capitals on the continent gave him tumultuous receptions.</p>

                <h2>A Woman of Paris (1923)</h2>
                <p>A Woman of Paris was a courageous step in the career of Charles Chaplin. After seventy films in which
                    he
                    himself had appeared in every scene, he now directed a picture in which he merely walked on for a
                    few
                    seconds as an unbilled and unrecognisable extra – a porter at a railroad station. Until this time,
                    every
                    film had been a comedy. A Woman of Paris was a romantic drama. This was not a sudden impulse. For a
                    long
                    time Chaplin had wanted to try his hand at directing a serious film.</p>

                <h2>The Gold Rush (1925)</h2>
                <p>Chaplin generally strove to separate his work from his private life; but in this case the two became
                    inextricably and painfully mixed. Searching for a new leading lady, he rediscovered Lillita
                    MacMurray,
                    whom he had employed, as a pretty 12-year-old, in The Kid. Still not yet sixteen, Lillita was put
                    under
                    contract and re-named Lita Grey.</p>

                    alt="Chaplin and Lita Grey sign the contract for The Gold Rush">
                <p>Chaplin quickly embarked on a clandestine affair with her; and when the film was six months into
                    shooting, Lita discovered she was pregnant. Chaplin found himself forced into a marriage which
                    brought
                    misery to both partners, though it produced two sons, Charles Jr and Sydney Chaplin.</p>

                <h2>The Circus (1928)</h2>
                <p>The Circus won Charles Chaplin his first Academy Award – it was still not yet called the ‘Oscar’ – he
                    was
                    given it at the first presentations ceremony, in 1929. But as late as 1964, it seemed, this was a
                    film
                    he preferred to forget. The reason was not the film itself, but the deeply fraught circumstances
                    surrounding its making.</p>
                <img src="http://photo.charliechaplin.com/images/photos/0000/0712/Studio_Fire_Circus_set_Number_6_big.jpg"
                    alt="Chaplin on the set of The Circus after a fire raged through the studio during the ninth month of shooting, destroying sets and props.">
                <p>Chaplin was in the throes of the break-up of his marriage with Lita Grey; and production of The
                    Circus
                    coincided with one of the most unseemly and sensational divorces of twenties Hollywood, as Lita’s
                    lawyers sought every means to ruin Chaplin’s career by smearing his reputation. As if his domestic
                    troubles were not enough, the film seemed fated to catastrophe of every kind.</p>
                <p>In the late 1960s, after the years spent trying to forget it, Chaplin returned to The Circus to
                    re-release it with a new musical score of his own composition. It seemed to symbolize his
                    reconciliation
                    to the film which cost him so much stress.</p>

                <h2>City Lights (1931)</h2>
                <p>City Lights proved to be the hardest and longest undertaking of Chaplin’s career. By the time it was
                    completed he had spent two years and eight months on the work, with almost 190 days of actual
                    shooting.
                    The marvel is that the finished film betrays nothing of this effort and anxiety.</p>
                <p>Even before he began City Lights, the sound film was firmly established. This new revolution was a
                    bigger
                    challenge to Chaplin than to other silent stars. His Tramp character was universal. His mime was
                    understood in every part of the world. But if the Tramp now began to speak in English, that
                    world-wide
                    audience would instantly shrink.</p>
                <p>Chaplin boldly solved the problem by ignoring speech, and making City Lights in the way he had always
                    worked before, as a silent film. However he astounded the press and the public by composing the
                    entire
                    score for City Lights.</p>
                <img src="http://photo.charliechaplin.com/images/photos/0000/8410/x276_big.jpg"
                    alt="Chaplin with Albert Einstein and his wife at the City Lights premiere">
                <p>The premieres were among the most brilliant the cinema had ever seen. In Los Angeles, Chaplin’s guest
                    was
                    Albert Einstein; while in London Bernard Shaw sat beside him. City Lights was a critical triumph.
                    All
                    Chaplin’s struggles and anxieties, it seemed, were compensated by the film which still appears as
                    the
                    zenith of his achievement and reputation.</p>

                <h2>Modern Times (1936)</h2>
                <p>Chaplin was acutely preoccupied with the social and economic problems of this new age. In 1931 and
                    1932
                    he had left Hollywood behind, to embark on an 18-month world tour. In Europe, he had been disturbed
                    to
                    see the rise of nationalism and the social effects of the Depression, of unemployment and of
                    automation.
                </p>
                <p>He read books on economic theory; and devised his own Economic Solution, an intelligent exercise in
                    utopian idealism, based on a more equitable distribution not just of wealth but of work. In 1931 he
                    told
                    a newspaper interviewer, “Unemployment is the vital question . . . Machinery should benefit mankind.
                    It
                    should not spell tragedy and throw it out of work”.</p>

                    alt="Chaplin, out of costume, rehearses the famous feeding machine sequence">
                <p>In Modern Times Chaplin set out to transform his observations and anxieties into comedy. The little
                    Tramp
                    - described in the film credits as “a Factory Worker”- is now one of the millions coping with the
                    problems of the 1930s, which are not so very different from anxieties of the 21st century - poverty,
                    unemployment, strikes and strike breakers, political intolerance, economic inequalities, the tyranny
                    of
                    the machine, narcotics.</p>

                <h2>The Great Dictator (1940)</h2>
                <p>When writing The Great Dictator in 1939, Chaplin was as famous worldwide as Hitler, and his Tramp
                    character wore the same moustache. He decided to pit his celebrity and humour against the dictator’s
                    own
                    celebrity and evil. He benefited – if that is the right word for it, given the times – from his
                    “reputation” as a Jew, which he was not – (he said “I do not have that pleasure”).</p>
                <p>In the film Chaplin plays a dual role –a Jewish barber who lost his memory in a plane accident in the
                    first war, and spent years in hospital before being discharged into an antisemite country that he
                    does
                    not understand, and Hynkel, the dictator leader of Tomania, whose armies are the forces of the
                    Double
                    Cross, and who will do anything along those lines to increase his possibilities for becoming emperor
                    of
                    the world. Chaplin’s aim is obvious, and the film ends with a now famous and humanitarian speech
                    made by
                    the barber, speaking Chaplin’s own words.</p>

                <h2>Monsieur Verdoux (1947)</h2>
                <p>The idea was originally suggested by Orson Welles, as a project for a dramatised documentary on the
                    career of the legendary French murder Henri Désiré Landru – who was executed in 1922, having
                    murdered at
                    least ten women, two dogs and one boy.</p>
                <p>Chaplin was so intrigued by the idea that he paid Welles $5000 for it. The agreement was signed in
                    1941,
                    but Chaplin took four more years to complete the script. In the meantime the irritating distractions
                    of
                    a much-publicised and ugly paternity suit had been compensated by his brilliantly successful
                    marriage to
                    Oona O’Neill.

                    alt="Chaplin and Martha Raye with dancers during the shooting of Monsieur Verdoux">
                <p>In the late 1940s, America¹s Cold War paranoia reached its peak, and Chaplin, as a foreigner with
                    liberal
                    and humanist sympathies, was a prime target for political witch-hunters. This was the start of
                    Chaplin’s
                    last and unhappiest period in the United States, which he was definitively to leave in 1952.</p>

                <h2>Limelight (1952)</h2>
                <p>Not surprisingly, then, in choosing his next subject he deliberately sought escape from disagreeable
                    contemporary reality. He found it in bitter-sweet nostalgia for the world of his youth – the world
                    of
                    the London music halls at the opening of the 20th century, where he had first discovered his genius
                    as
                    an entertainer.</p>
                <img src="http://photo.charliechaplin.com/images/photos/0000/0090/lime_456_big.jpg"
                    alt="Buster Keaton and Chaplin in Limelight, 1952">
                <p>With this strong underlay of nostalgia, Chaplin was at pains to evoke as accurately as possible the
                    London he remembered from half a century before and it is clear from the preparatory notes for the
                    film
                    that the character of Calvero had a very similar childhood to Chaplin’s own. Limelight’s story of a
                    once
                    famous music hall artist whom nobody finds amusing any longer may well have been similarly
                    autobiographical as a sort of nightmare scenario.</p>
                <p>Chaplin’s son Sydney plays the young, talented pianist who vies with Calvero for the young
                    ballerina’s
                    heart, and several other Chaplin family members participated in the film. It was when on the boat
                    travelling with his family to the London premiere of Limelight that Chaplin learned that his
                    re-entry
                    pass to the United States had been rescinded based on allegations regarding his morals and politics.
                </p>
                <p>Chaplin therefore remained in Europe, and settled with his family at the Manoir de Ban in Corsier sur
                    Vevey, Switzerland, with view of lake and mountains. What a difference from California. He and Oona
                    went
                    on to have four more children, making a total of eight.</p>

                <p>With A King in New York Charles Chaplin was the first film-maker to dare to expose, through satire
                    and
                    ridicule, the paranoia and political intolerance which overtook the United States in the Cold War
                    years
                    of the 1940s and 50s. Chaplin himself had bitter personal experience of the American malaise of that
                    time.</p>
                <p>To take up film making again, as an exile, was a challenging undertaking. He was now nearing 70. For
                    almost forty years he had enjoyed the luxury of his own studio and a staff of regular employees, who
                    understood his way of work. Now though he had to work with strangers, in costly and unfriendly
                    rented
                    studios. The film shows the strain.</p>

                <p>In 1966 he produced his last picture, “A Countess from Hong Kong” for Universal Pictures, his only
                    film
                    in colour, starring Sophia Loren and Marlon Brando. The film started as a project called Stowaway in
                    the
                    1930s, planned for Paulette Goddard. Chaplin appears briefly as a ship steward, Chaplin’s son Sydney
                    once again has an important role, and three of Chaplin’s daughters have small parts in the film. The
                    film was unsuccessful at the box office, but Petula Clark had one or two hit records with songs from
                    the
                    soundtrack music and the music continues to be very popular.</p>
