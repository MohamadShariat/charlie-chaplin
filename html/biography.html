            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London, England, on April 16th, 1889. His father was a versatile
                vocalist
                and actor; and his mother, known under the stage name of Lily Harley, was an attractive actress and
                singer,
                who gained a reputation for her work in the light opera field.

                Charlie was thrown on his own resources before he reached the age of ten as the early death of his
                father
                and the subsequent illness of his mother made it necessary for Charlie and his brother, Sydney, to fend
                for
                themselves.</p>

            <p>Having inherited natural talents from their parents, the youngsters took to the stage as the best
                opportunity for a career. Charlie made his professional debut as a member of a juvenile group called
                “The Eight Lancashire Lads” and rapidly won popular favour as an outstanding tap dancer.</p>

            <h2>Beginning of his career</h2>
            <p>When he was about twelve, he got his first chance to act in a legitimate stage show, and appeared as
                “Billy” the page boy, in support of first H. A. Saintsbury and then William Gillette in different
                productions of “Sherlock Holmes”. At the close of this engagement, Charlie started a career as a
                comedian in vaudeville, which eventually took him to the United States in 1910 as a featured player with
                the Fred Karno Company.</p>

                alt="Alf and Amy Reeves, Muriel Palmer & Chaplin on the boat to America for the 1910 Karno tour">
            <p>He scored an immediate hit with American audiences, particularly with his characterization in a sketch
                entitled “A Night in an English Music Hall”. When the Fred Karno troupe returned to the United States in
                the fall of 1912 for a repeat tour, Chaplin was offered a motion picture contract.</p>
            <p>He finally agreed to appear before the cameras at the expiration of his vaudeville commitments in
                November 1913; and his entrance in the cinema world took place that month when he joined Mack Sennett
                and the Keystone Film Company. His initial salary was $150 a week, but his overnight success on the
                screen spurred other producers to start negotiations for his services.</p>

            <p>
                At the completion of his Sennett contract, Chaplin moved on to the Essanay Company (1915) at a large
                increase. Sydney Chaplin had then arrived from England, and took his brother’s place with Keystone as
                their leading comedian.

                The following year Charlie was even more in demand and signed with the Mutual Film Corporation for a
                much larger sum to make 12 two-reel comedies. These include “The Floorwalker”, “The Fireman”, “The
                Vagabond”, “One A.M.” (a production in which he was the only character for the entire two reels with the
                exception of the entrance of a cab driver in the opening scene), “The Count”, “The Pawnshop”, “Behind
                the Screen”, “The Rink”, “Easy Street” (heralded as his greatest production up to that time), “The
                Cure”, “The Immigrant” and “The Adventurer”.

            <h2>Gaining independence</h2>
            <p>When his contract with Mutual expired in 1917, Chaplin decided to become an independent producer in a
                desire for more freedom and greater leisure in making his movies. To that end, he busied himself with
                the construction of his own studios. This plant was situated in the heart of the residential section of
                Hollywood at La Brea Avenue.</p>

                alt="Chaplin ready to build his studios at the corner of La Brea Avenue and De Longpre Avenue">
            <p>Early in 1918, Chaplin entered into an agreement with First National Exhibitors’ Circuit, a new
                organization specially formed to exploit his pictures. His first film under this new deal was “A Dog’s
                Life”. After this production, he turned his attention to a national tour on behalf of the war effort,
                following which he made a film the US government used to popularize the Liberty Loan drive: “The Bond”.
            </p>
            <p>His next commercial venture was the production of a comedy dealing with the war. “Shoulder Arms”,
                released in 1918 at a most opportune time, proved a veritable mirthquake at the box office and added
                enormously to Chaplin’s popularity.</p>

                alt="Sunnyside, 1919">
            <p>He followed “Shoulder Arms” with “Sunnyside” and “A Day’s Pleasure”, both released in 1919. In April of
                that year, Chaplin joined with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith to found the United
                Artists Corporation. B.B. Hampton, in his “History of the Movies” says: <q>The corporation was
                    organized as a distributor, each of the artists retaining entire control of his or
                    her respective producing activities, delivering to United Artists the completed pictures for
                    distribution on the same general plan they would have followed with a distributing organization
                    which
                    they did not own. The stock of United Artists was divided equally among the founders. This
                    arrangement
                    introduced a new method into the industry. Heretofore, producers and distributors had been the
                    employers, paying salaries and sometimes a share of the profits to the stars. Under the United
                    Artists
                    system, the stars became their own employers. They had to do their own financing, but they received
                    the
                    producer profits that had formerly gone to their employers and each received his share of the
                    profits of
                    the distributing organization.</q></p>
